{"question": "Explain the distributive property of multiplication over addition.", "answer": "The distributive property states that a(b+c) = ab + ac. For example, 3(4+2) = 3×4 + 3×2 = 12 + 6 = 18.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is a rational number?", "answer": "A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not zero. Examples include 1/2, 3/4, -5/7, and 2 (which can be written as 2/1).", "contexts": []}
{"question": "How do you convert a fraction to a decimal?", "answer": "To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. The result may be a terminating decimal (like 1/4 = 0.25) or a repeating decimal (like 1/3 = 0.333...).", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the Pythagorean theorem?", "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b): a² + b² = c².", "contexts": []}
{"question": "Explain the concept of photosynthesis.", "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. They use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. The chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the difference between a simile and a metaphor?", "answer": "A simile is a figure of speech that compares two things using 'like' or 'as' (e.g., 'as brave as a lion'). A metaphor directly states that one thing is another thing (e.g., 'he is a lion'). Both are used to make comparisons, but similes use explicit comparison words while metaphors make direct comparisons.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "How does the water cycle work?", "answer": "The water cycle consists of evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor forming clouds), precipitation (rain, snow, etc.), and collection (water returning to oceans, lakes, etc.). This continuous process redistributes water around the Earth.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the difference between a compound and a mixture?", "answer": "A compound is a pure substance formed when two or more elements chemically combine in fixed proportions (like H₂O). A mixture is a combination of substances that are not chemically bonded and can be separated by physical means (like salt water).", "contexts": []}
{"question": "Explain the concept of gravity.", "answer": "Gravity is a fundamental force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. On Earth, it pulls everything toward the center of the planet. The force of gravity depends on the mass of objects and the distance between them, following Newton's law of universal gravitation.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the difference between a democracy and a dictatorship?", "answer": "In a democracy, power comes from the people through voting and elections, with multiple political parties and freedom of speech. In a dictatorship, power is concentrated in one person or small group, often without free elections or civil liberties.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "How do you find the area of a circle?", "answer": "The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = πr², where A is the area, π (pi) is approximately 3.14159, and r is the radius of the circle. For example, a circle with radius 5 units has area π × 5² = 25π square units.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the difference between a primary and secondary source?", "answer": "A primary source is an original document or firsthand account created at the time of an event (like diaries, letters, photographs). A secondary source interprets or analyzes primary sources (like textbooks, articles, documentaries).", "contexts": []}
{"question": "Explain the concept of supply and demand.", "answer": "Supply and demand is an economic principle where the price of a good is determined by the relationship between how much is available (supply) and how much people want to buy (demand). When demand is high and supply is low, prices rise. When supply is high and demand is low, prices fall.", "contexts": []}
{"question": "What is the difference between a physical and chemical change?", "answer": "A physical change alters the form or appearance of matter without changing its chemical composition (like melting ice). A chemical change creates new substances with different properties (like burning wood to create ash and smoke).", "contexts": []}
{"question": "How do you solve a quadratic equation?", "answer": "A quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0 can be solved using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. You can also factor the equation or complete the square, depending on the specific equation.", "contexts": []}
