## 🎯 **Reorganization Plan**

### **Phase 1: Role-Based Folder Structure**

#### **New Folder Structure:**
```
[locale]/
├── (auth)/
│   └── login/
├── student/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── ai-teacher/
│   ├── assessments/
│   ├── adaptive-teaching/
│   └── chat/
├── teacher/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── curriculum/
│   ├── assessments/
│   ├── rag/
│   ├── adaptive-teaching/
│   └── chat/
├── admin/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── users/
│   ├── documents/
│   ├── guardians/
│   ├── evaluations/
│   ├── adaptive-teaching/
│   └── chat/
├── super-admin/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── organizations/
│   └── system/
├── guardian/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── progress/
└── shared/
    ├── adaptive-teaching/
    └── unsubscribe-success/
```

### **Phase 2: Role-Specific Dashboards**

#### **Student Dashboard** (`/student/dashboard/`)
- **Purpose**: Student learning hub
- **Features**:
  - AI Teacher access
  - Assessment center
  - Progress tracking
  - Adaptive teaching insights
  - Chat with teachers/peers

#### **Teacher Dashboard** (`/teacher/dashboard/`)
- **Purpose**: Teaching management hub
- **Features**:
  - Curriculum management
  - Assessment creation
  - Student progress monitoring
  - Content upload (RAG)
  - Adaptive teaching analytics
  - Chat with students/admins

#### **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard/`)
- **Purpose**: Organization management
- **Features**:
  - User management
  - Document management
  - Guardian relationships
  - System evaluations
  - Organization analytics
  - Chat management

#### **Super Admin Dashboard** (`/super-admin/dashboard/`)
- **Purpose**: System-wide management
- **Features**:
  - Organization management
  - System-wide analytics
  - Global settings
  - Multi-tenant oversight

#### **Guardian Dashboard** (`/guardian/dashboard/`)
- **Purpose**: Student progress monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Student progress reports
  - Communication with teachers
  - Assessment results
  - Learning insights

### **Phase 3: Folder Consolidation**

#### **Merge Strategy:**

1. **Tutor vs Teacher Resolution:**
   - **Keep**: `teacher/` folder (more comprehensive)
   - **Merge**: `tutor/` functionality into `teacher/curriculum/`
   - **Reason**: Tutor was the old Q&A system, Teacher has the new AI Teacher system

2. **Dashboard Consolidation:**
   - **Keep**: `dashboard_new/` (more modern UI)
   - **Replace**: `dashboard/` with role-specific dashboards
   - **Reason**: dashboard_new has better design, but we need role-specific versions

3. **AI Teacher Consolidation:**
   - **Keep**: `ai-teacher/` (connected to data)
   - **Remove**: `ai-teacher_new/` (not connected)
   - **Move**: To role-specific folders

### **Phase 4: Aside Component Fix and Enhancement**

#### **Current Aside Component Issues:**
1. **Broken Navigation Links**: Many paths don't exist or are incorrect
2. **Missing Icons**: Some roles have incomplete icon sets
3. **Inconsistent Paths**: Links don't match the actual folder structure
4. **Role-Specific Features**: Learning modes and daily goals only for students

#### **Aside Component Fixes Needed:**

**Current Broken Links:**
- `/users` - doesn't exist
- `/curriculum` - should be `/teacher/curriculum`
- `/subjects` - should be `/teacher/curriculum`
- `/students` - doesn't exist
- `/progress` - doesn't exist
- `/courses` - should be `/student/ai-teacher`
- `/practice` - doesn't exist
- `/achievements` - doesn't exist
- `/children` - doesn't exist
- `/reports` - doesn't exist
- `/analytics` - doesn't exist
- `/settings` - doesn't exist

**Fixed Navigation Structure:**
```typescript
const roleSpecificItems = {
  'super_admin': [
    { icon: School, label: 'Organizations', path: '/super-admin/organizations' },
    { icon: Users, label: 'All Users', path: '/super-admin/users' },
    { icon: BarChart3, label: 'Global Analytics', path: '/super-admin/analytics' },
    { icon: Settings, label: 'System Settings', path: '/super-admin/settings' },
  ],
  'admin': [
    { icon: Users, label: 'Manage Users', path: '/admin/users' },
    { icon: BookOpen, label: 'Curriculum', path: '/admin/curriculum' },
    { icon: BarChart3, label: 'School Analytics', path: '/admin/analytics' },
    { icon: Settings, label: 'School Settings', path: '/admin/settings' },
  ],
  'teacher': [
    { icon: BookOpen, label: 'My Subjects', path: '/teacher/curriculum' },
    { icon: ClipboardCheck, label: 'Assessments', path: '/teacher/assessments' },
    { icon: Users, label: 'My Students', path: '/teacher/students' },
    { icon: BarChart3, label: 'Class Progress', path: '/teacher/progress' },
    { icon: FileText, label: 'Upload Content', path: '/teacher/rag' },
  ],
  'student': [
    { icon: Brain, label: 'AI Teacher', path: '/student/ai-teacher' },
    { icon: BookMarked, label: 'My Courses', path: '/student/courses' },
    { icon: Target, label: 'Assessments', path: '/student/assessments' },
    { icon: Trophy, label: 'Achievements', path: '/student/achievements' },
    { icon: MessageSquare, label: 'Study Chat', path: '/student/chat' },
    { icon: BarChart3, label: 'My Progress', path: '/student/progress' },
    { icon: Sparkles, label: 'Adaptive Teaching', path: '/student/adaptive-teaching' },
  ],
  'guardian': [
    { icon: Users, label: 'My Children', path: '/guardian/children' },
    { icon: BarChart3, label: 'Progress Reports', path: '/guardian/reports' },
    { icon: MessageSquare, label: 'Teacher Chat', path: '/guardian/chat' },
  ],
};
```

### **Phase 5: Access Control Implementation**

#### **Middleware Updates:**
```typescript
// Enhanced middleware with role-based routing
const roleBasedRoutes = {
  student: ['/student', '/shared'],
  teacher: ['/teacher', '/shared'],
  admin: ['/admin', '/shared'],
  super_admin: ['/super-admin', '/admin', '/shared'],
  guardian: ['/guardian', '/shared']
};
```

#### **Login Redirect Logic:**
```typescript
// Role-based redirect after login
const getRoleDashboard = (role: string) => {
  switch (role) {
    case 'student': return '/student/dashboard';
    case 'teacher': return '/teacher/dashboard';
    case 'admin': return '/admin/dashboard';
    case 'super_admin': return '/super-admin/dashboard';
    case 'guardian': return '/guardian/dashboard';
    default: return '/student/dashboard';
  }
};
```

   - The most new design is `Topbar_last.tsx` but may need to add some links at user drop-down
   - Keep only `Topbar.tsx` as the main topbar component

2. **Investigate Tutor Components:**
   - `tutor/ChatHistory.tsx` might be legacy from old tutor system
   - Consider removing if not needed for new AI Teacher system

3. **Component Organization:**
   - All other components are actively used and should be preserved
   - Consider organizing components into subfolders by functionality
