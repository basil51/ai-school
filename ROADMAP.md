- âœ… Implement helpers: chunk, embed, vector search
- âœ… API:
  - `/api/content/upload` (store doc meta, length)
  - `/api/rag/ingest` (chunk â†’ embed â†’ insert)
  - `/api/rag/query` (topâ€‘k retrieval)
- âœ… Minimal UI page `/rag` for upload + ask (nonâ€‘streaming)

Exit criteria: Upload .txt, ingest, ask a question, receive grounded answer with snippets. **COMPLETED**

## Phase 3 â€” Streaming Tutor Endpoint + UI (DONE) âœ…
- âœ… Add `/api/chat/lesson` streaming variant (Vercel AI SDK)
- âœ… Client page `/tutor` with streaming answer area
- âœ… Basic citations format like `[1]`, `[2]`
- âœ… Integrate RAG retrieval with streaming LLM responses
- âœ… Navigation links from home and dashboard

Exit criteria: See streamed answers citing retrieved context. **COMPLETED**

---

## Phase 4 â€” Ingestion at Scale (Background Jobs) (IN PROGRESS) ðŸ”„
- Add Redis and BullMQ
- Worker app to process ingestion (batch embeddings, progress updates)
- API to enqueue jobs + status endpoint
- Frontend polling for job status
- Handle large documents efficiently

Exit criteria: Large docs ingest asynchronously with visible progress until completion.

---

## Phase 5 â€” UX + Admin
- shadcn/ui integration for forms, modals, tables

- RAGAS metrics: faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_precision, context_recall
- Nightly CI with GitHub Actions
- Golden dataset with Q/A pairs
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector)
- Similarity thresholding + reâ€‘ranking

Exit criteria: Evaluation dashboard shows nightly scores; hybrid search improves answer quality.

---

## Phase 7 â€” Ops & Deployment
- Environment configs, secrets
- Database migrations workflow
- Observability (logs/metrics), backups
- Deployment to Vercel (web) + managed Postgres, Redis

Exit criteria: Deployed app with monitoring and documented runbooks.

---

---

## Phase 9 â€” Stretch Goals
