- Next.js app scaffolded in `web/` (App Router + TS)
- TailwindCSS wired
- Axios, React Query installed
- Postgres via Docker (port 5433)
- Prisma initialized; `User` + `Role` models; migrated
- Seed users created

Exit criteria: `pnpm dev` runs and DB is migrated/seeded.

---

## Phase 1 â€” Auth + RBAC (DONE) âœ…
- âœ… NextAuth Credentials provider
- âœ… Register endpoint hashing passwords (argon2)
- âœ… JWT session with role on token/session
- âœ… Middleware protecting `/dashboard`, `/teacher`, `/admin`
- âœ… Simple sign-in form and sign-out
- âœ… Dashboard with user info and role display
- âœ… RBAC utilities for API route protection

Exit criteria: Can sign in with seeded users; role-gated routes enforced. **COMPLETED**

---

## Phase 2 â€” RAG Foundations (DONE) âœ…
- âœ… Install `openai`, `ai`, `zod`
- âœ… Enable pgvector in Postgres and Prisma types
- âœ… Create `RagDocument` and `RagChunk` models with `embedding vector(1536)` + index
- âœ… Implement helpers: chunk, embed, vector search
- âœ… API:
  - `/api/content/upload` (store doc meta, length)
  - `/api/rag/ingest` (chunk â†’ embed â†’ insert)
  - `/api/rag/query` (topâ€‘k retrieval)
- âœ… Minimal UI page `/rag` for upload + ask (nonâ€‘streaming)

Exit criteria: Upload .txt, ingest, ask a question, receive grounded answer with snippets. **COMPLETED**

---

## Phase 3 â€” Streaming Tutor Endpoint + UI (IN PROGRESS) ðŸ”„
- Add `/api/chat/lesson` streaming variant (Vercel AI SDK)
- Client page `/tutor` with streaming answer area
- Basic citations format like `[1]`, `[2]`
- Integrate RAG retrieval with streaming LLM responses

Exit criteria: See streamed answers citing retrieved context.

---

## Phase 4 â€” Ingestion at Scale (Background Jobs)
- Add Redis and BullMQ
- Worker app to process ingestion (batch embeddings, progress updates)
- API to enqueue jobs + status endpoint
- Frontend polling for job status

Exit criteria: Large docs ingest asynchronously with visible progress until completion.

---

## Phase 5 â€” UX + Admin
- shadcn/ui integration for forms, modals, tables
- Teacherâ€‘only uploads; admin panel for users/docs
- Roleâ€‘aware navigation and dashboards

Exit criteria: Roleâ€‘based navigation; teachers upload; admins manage users and docs.

---

## Phase 6 â€” Quality & Search
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector)
- RAGAS based nightly evaluation and score tracking
- Similarity thresholding + reâ€‘ranking

Exit criteria: Evaluation dashboard shows nightly scores; hybrid search improves answer quality.

---

## Phase 7 â€” Ops & Deployment
- Environment configs, secrets
- Database migrations workflow
- Observability (logs/metrics), backups
- Deployment to Vercel (web) + managed Postgres, Redis

Exit criteria: Deployed app with monitoring and documented runbooks.

---

## Phase 8 â€” Stretch Goals
- Multiâ€‘tenant orgs (schools)
- Guardian portal, attendance/grades integrations
- Classroom chat, lesson plans, assignment generation

---

## Tracking
- See `STATUS.md` for weekly status, blockers, and next actions.
