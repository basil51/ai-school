My vision is to create an AI-powered teaching system that surpasses traditional methods. Instead of relying on a static textbook, this intelligent teacher will leverage artificial intelligence to create the most effective learning methods for each student dynamically.

As lessons progress, the system will identify the best learning patterns and styles, algorithmically tailoring the material to the unique needs of every individual.

The system should be designed for continuous improvement. If a student fails to master a concept or perform well on an assessment, the intelligent teacher will automatically generate a new explanation and approach to address the issue.

This adaptive learning loop is designed to fill knowledge gaps from the previous method, ensuring the student achieves a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The ultimate goal is to maximize student success.

By providing a truly personalized and adaptive learning experience, our objective is to ensure that a majority, if not all, students can fully grasp the material and achieve exceptional grades and academic results. Add any needed phases or steps, modify or update to arrive at the described AI teacher.
