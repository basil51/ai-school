## Phase 21 — Evaluation & Optimization (NEW)

**Duration:** 4 weeks (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026)

**Description:**
A final system-wide evaluation and optimization phase before v1.0 release. Ensures not only educational impact but also scalability, inclusivity, and integration.

**Key Tasks:**
- 🔹 A/B testing of teaching adaptations across different student groups
- 🔹 Collect user feedback systematically (students, parents, teachers)
- 🔹 Inclusivity audit (e.g., ADHD-friendly pacing, accessibility compliance)
- 🔹 Scalability testing (target: 1,000+ concurrent students)
- 🔹 LMS / school system API integrations
- 🔹 Continuous monitoring setup (usage analytics, performance metrics)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Achieve >90% mastery rate across pilot groups
- Demonstrate scalability and responsiveness under heavy load
- Pass inclusivity and accessibility audits
- v1.0 ready for school / institutional deployment
