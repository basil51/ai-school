```

### Integration with SmartLearningCanvas
The TextFormatter is automatically used when the content type is 'text' in both:

## Text Formatting Rules

### Automatic Detection
The component automatically detects and formats:

1. **Headings**: Lines shorter than 100 characters that don't end with punctuation
2. **Lists**: Lines starting with `-`, `â€¢`, `*`, or numbered items (`1.`, `2.`, etc.)
3. **Key Concepts**: Text within quotes (`"concept"`)
4. **Paragraphs**: Regular text blocks separated by double line breaks

### Example Input
```
What is Photosynthesis?

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.

Key Components:
- Chlorophyll: The green pigment
- Carbon Dioxide: From atmosphere
- Water: From roots

The Process:
1. Light absorption
2. Water splitting
3. Glucose production
4. Oxygen release
```

### Rendered Output
- **"What is Photosynthesis?"** â†’ Large heading with bookmark option
