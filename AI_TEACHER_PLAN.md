# AI Teacher Plan

This document extends the existing roadmap beyond Phase 11, adding the critical phases required to transform the project into a **true adaptive AI Teacher**, as envisioned.

---

## Phase 12 — Curriculum Engine

* **Dynamic Subject Model**: Define `Subject`, `Topic`, `Lesson` entities in the database.
* **Curriculum Planner**: AI generates a structured course outline per student (progression of lessons).
* **Adaptive Pathways**: Lessons adapt based on assessment results (slow down, review, or accelerate).
* **Exit Criteria**: Students selecting "Math" or "History" receive a personalized curriculum instead of open Q\&A.

---

## Phase 13 — Assessment System

* **Quizzes & Tests**: Auto-generated multiple-choice, short-answer, or coding exercises.
* **Homework Assignments**: Stored in DB, linked to student and subject.
* **Grading API**: AI auto-grades, with rubrics and potential teacher override.
* **Exit Criteria**: Students progress only after completing and passing quizzes/tests.

---

## Phase 14 — Adaptive Teaching Loop

* **Failure Recovery**: If student fails, AI re-teaches with a different approach.
* **Alternative Modalities**: Visual (charts, diagrams), analogy-based, step-by-step methods.
* **Review Cycles**: Students retry until mastery is demonstrated.
* **Exit Criteria**: Students see “Try Again” with fresh explanations until they pass.

---

## Phase 15 — Multi-Modal Teaching (Stretch Goal)

* **Diagrams & Visuals**: Integrate rendering engines (KaTeX/MathJax for math, chart libraries for visuals).
* **Narrated Explanations (TTS)**: Text-to-speech for accessibility and alternative learning styles.
* **Exit Criteria**: At least one subject (Math) taught with text, equations, and visual aids.

---

## Phase 16 — Long-Term Learning Memory

* **Student Profiles**: Track strengths, weaknesses, and learning style preferences.
* **Learning History**: Store which explanation types were most effective per student.
* **Personalization Engine**: Future lessons adapt based on past performance and preferences.
* **Exit Criteria**: Each student gets a continuously improving AI teacher experience.

---

## Outcome

With Phases 12–16, the system evolves from a **Q\&A + RAG pipeline** into a **full adaptive AI Academy**:

* Structured curriculum generation.
* Continuous adaptation with quizzes/tests.
* Multi-modal explanations when concepts aren’t mastered.
* Personalized, long-term learning paths.

This closes the gap with your original vision: *a personal AI teacher that ensures every student achieves mastery, not just a chatbot for answers.*
